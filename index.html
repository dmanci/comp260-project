				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						So what is an R-Tree, anyway?
					</span>
					<span class='answer'>
						Well, an R-Tree is a data structure used for
						efficiently storing information about spatial objects.
					</span><br><br>

					<span class='question'>
						Ok... so what's a spatial object then?
					</span>
					<span class='answer'>
						A spatial object could be a road, a movie
						theater, a plot of land... really, anything object that contains space. (And not
						just three-dimensional space - space in any number of dimensions you
						like!)
					</span><br><br>

					<span class='question'>
						So why do we need something like the R-Tree. Can't we just store it in a
						database somewhere?
					</span>
					<span class='answer'>
						We could. But consider if you had a database full of spatial objects. Each
						row told you where the object is on a coordinate plane and some information
						about the object. For a restaurant might have a latitude and longitude, plus
						some reviews of the food. If we know the restaurant, we can look it up like
						any other data and find out how good the food is.
						<br><br>
						But what if we want to know all the restaurants within a few miles of a given
						location with at least four stars? We could naively go through every record
						in our database, compute the distance from our reference location, check the
						reviews, and return the qualifying restaurants. That seems like a lot of
						work, though.
						<br><br>
						That's where the R-Tree comes in handy...

				<h2>The R-Tree</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						What's the deal with the R-Tree?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						The R-Tree was developed in 1984 by <a href="#">Antonin Guttman</a> as a
						solution to the problem described in the introduction. Here's the basic
						concept of the R-Tree:
						<br><br>
						<i>For each object, create a box that tightly encloses it. Then make a
						number of larger boxes, each of which tightly encloses a number of smaller
						boxes. Give each node in the tree its own box. When we search for an object,
						use the larger boxes to cut out branches of the tree. We no longer have to look through every
						single record in our database, but only those close to the area we care
						about!</i>

				<h2>A Few R-Tree Details</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						What makes up an R-Tree?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						An R-Tree has three main components: (1) Internal nodes, (2) Leaf nodes, and
						(3) entries.
						<br><br>
						(1) We'll start with a leaf. Leaves contain a number of "entries." A leaf entry
						contains all the information on where to find the spatial object in our database. 
						This might be a unique key, or even a direct pointer to the record. A leaf
						entry also contains that box we made around our object - call this our
						minimum bounding box.
						<br><br>
						(2) Internal nodes also contain a number of entries, except in this case,
						each entry has a pointer to a child node. Which node?
						Like leaf entries, internal entries have a box. This time, the box encloses
						a number of smaller boxes. And instead of pointing to a record in the
						database, the entry points to a child node that has the entries enclosed by
						its box.

				<h2>A Few R-Tree Details</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						Are there rules for an R-Tree?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						Like other trees, there are a few rules to follow.
						<br><br>
						(1) We can't just put any amount of entries into a node - we need to bound this
						number. Let's say a node must have at least m entries, and no more than M
						entries. What's more, m must be at least half of M.
						<br><br>
						(2) All leaf nodes must appear on the same level. That is, no branch will ever
						be longer than any other.
						<br><br>
						(3) The root node must have at least two children, unless it is a leaf.

				<h2>The Insertion Algorithm</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						Where should we insert a new record?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						First, we need to find an appropriate leaf.
						<br><br>
						(1) Start at the root node.
						<br><br>
						(2) If it's a leaf, let's choose it.
						<br><br>
						(3) If it's an internal node, let's inspect its entries:<br>
						Let's hypothetically consider we add the new record to an entry. How
						much larger do we need to the make that entry's box? Now repeat for the
						other entries. Which one needed to be enlarged the least? Choose that one.
						And if entries tie, choose the one whose area is the smallest.
						<br><br>
						Remember, the chosen entry is internal, so it points to another node. Repeat 
						this process for the next node until we get to a leaf.
					</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='page hidden'>
				<h2>The Insertion Algorithm</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						Now do we add it to the leaf we just chose?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						Maybe. Recall that a node can have at most M entries, for some M that we
						chose. If the leaf has less than M, then sure, add it. Otherwise, we'll have
						to make some room by splitting the node into two new ones...
					</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='page hidden'>
				<h2>The Insertion Algorithm</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						How do we split a node?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						If we want to split node A, we could just make a new node, B, and give it
						some of node A's entries. But we want some more assurance that when we
						search in the future, we won't have to look in both of these entries. We can
						achieve this by minimizing the combined area of node A's box and node B's
						box. 
						There are a few ways of doing this:
						<br><br>
						(1) Try every combinations of groupings and pick the smallest area. This
						gives us the optimal solution, but takes a while (exponential in M,
						actually).
						<br><br>
						(2) We could use a quadratic algorithm instead. Without going into too much
						detail (this tutorial focuses on the third option), this algorithm chooses
						two "seed" entries by comparing the space wasted between pairs of entries.
						The pair of entries that waste the most space become the first entries in
						nodes A and B. It may not give us the absolute best split, but it's a lot faster.
						<br><br>
						(3) Finally, we can use a linear-time algorithm...
					</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='page hidden'>
				<h2>The Insertion Algorithm</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						How do we perform a linear split?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						(1) For each dimension, find the entry whose box has the highest low side,
						and the entry whose box has the lowest high side. In the x-y coordinate
						plane, this means finding a pair using the x-axis, and the pair using the
						y-axis. Once we find these, subtract to find the separation.
						<br><br>
						(2) Now find the total width (the separation of the most extreme points)
						along each dimension. On the y-axis, this means finding the highest and
						lowest y-coordinates, and subtracting.
						<br><br>
						(3) Now "normalize," by dividing the separation of each pair found in step
						(1) by the widths found in step (2).
						<br><br>
						(4) We'll choose the pair with the greatest separation as our
						starter entries for nodes A and B. This gives us a decent approximation of
						which entries would need a box that wastes the most space if they were in
						the same node.
						<br><br>
						(5) Lastly, randomly assign the remaining entries into each of the two
						nodes.

				<h2>The Insertion Algorithm</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						Are we done yet?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						Nope. Now we need to clean up the tree above the leaf, whether we split it
						or not.
						<br><br>
						(1) Start with the leaf we originally chose. Now go up the tree to its
						parent node (well, really the entry that points to it within the parent
						node).
						<br><br>
						(2) Recall that each internal entry contains a box that tightly encloses all the
						entries in its child node. Taking the parent of our insertion leaf, we'll
						make sure its box tightly encloses the new set of entries.
						<br><br>
						(3) But we're not done yet. If we split leaf A into leaf B, we need to
						attach that to the tree somewhere. If leaf A's parent has room, we can just
						create a new entry for it, and stick it there. But if it doesn't, we'll have
						to make a new parent node to contain it. How do we do that? Using the same
						method we used for splitting the original leaf node.
						<br><br>
						(4) Now repeat this whole process, but this time starting from the insertion
						leaf's parent node (and possibly, a split parent node, depending on what
						happened in step (3)). We're going to push our changes up the tree until we
						hit the root, fixing boxes and splitting nodes as we go.
						<br><br>
						(5) What happens if the root splits? Where do we go from there? That's easy.
						We make a new root, attaching the old root and the node that split from it.

				<h2>The Search Algorithm</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						Now that we have a tree, how do we find our records?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						Our new tree is pretty good at letting us search within some area - any area
						we want. So our search input might be something like, "give me all
						restaurants with four stars within so-and-so area."
					</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='page hidden'>
				<h2>The Search Algorithm</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						Great. How do we start?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						We start with the root node again and ask some questions.
						<br><br>
						(1) Are you a leaf node? If you are, let me check your entries. (Recall that
						leaf entries let us know where to find the actual record for the object
						we're after in the database, and tell us the approximate area that object
						covers.) If any of the entry boxes overlap my search area, go get those
						records (in this case, for a restaurant), and do any other filtering we
						asked for (in this case, restaurants with four stars).
						<br><br>
						(2) If you're a leaf, we'll still check each entry's box. Except this time,
						we'll have to descend down the tree when an entry's box overlaps, until we
						get to a leaf, where we'll proceed as in step (1).
