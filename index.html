				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						So what is an R-Tree, anyway?
					</span>
					<span class='answer'>
						Well, an R-Tree is a data structure used for
						efficiently storing information about spatial objects.
					</span><br><br>

					<span class='question'>
						Ok... so what's a spatial object then?
					</span>
					<span class='answer'>
						A spatial object could be a road, a movie
						theater, a plot of land... really, anything object that contains space. (And not
						just three-dimensional space - space in any number of dimensions you
						like!)
					</span><br><br>

					<span class='question'>
						So why do we need something like the R-Tree. Can't we just store it in a
						database somewhere?
					</span>
					<span class='answer'>
						We could. But consider if you had a database full of spatial objects. Each
						row told you where the object is on a coordinate plane and some information
						about the object. For a restaurant might have a latitude and longitude, plus
						some reviews of the food. If we know the restaurant, we can look it up like
						any other data and find out how good the food is.
						<br><br>
						But what if we want to know all the restaurants within a few miles of a given
						location with at least four stars? We could naively go through every record
						in our database, compute the distance from our reference location, check the
						reviews, and return the qualifying restaurants. That seems like a lot of
						work, though.
						<br><br>
						That's where the R-Tree comes in handy...

				<h2>The R-Tree</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						What's the deal with the R-Tree?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						The R-Tree was developed in 1984 by <a href="#">Antonin Guttman</a> as a
						solution to the problem described in the introduction. Here's the basic
						concept of the R-Tree:
						<br><br>
						<i>For each object, create a box that tightly encloses it. Then make a
						number of larger boxes, each of which tightly encloses a number of smaller
						boxes. Give each node in the tree its own box. When we search for an object,
						use the larger boxes to cut out branches of the tree. We no longer have to look through every
						single record in our database, but only those close to the area we care
						about!</i>

				<h2>A Few R-Tree Details</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						What makes up an R-Tree?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						An R-Tree has three main components: (1) Internal nodes, (2) Leaf nodes, and
						(3) entries.
						<br><br>
						(1) We'll start with a leaf. Leaves contain a number of "entries." A leaf entry
						contains all the information on where to find the spatial object in our database. 
						This might be a unique key, or even a direct pointer to the record. A leaf
						entry also contains that box we made around our object - call this our
						minimum bounding box.
						<br><br>
						(2) Internal nodes also contain a number of entries, except in this case,
						each entry has a pointer to a child node. Which node?
						Like leaf entries, internal entries have a box. This time, the box encloses
						a number of smaller boxes. And instead of pointing to a record in the
						database, the entry points to a child node that has the entries enclosed by
						its box.

				<h2>A Few R-Tree Details</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						Are there rules for an R-Tree?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						Like other trees, there are a few rules to follow.
						<br><br>
						(1) We can't just put any amount of entries into a node - we need to bound this
						number. Let's say a node must have at least m entries, and no more than M
						entries. What's more, m must be at least half of M.
						<br><br>
						(2) All leaf nodes must appear on the same level. That is, no branch will ever
						be longer than any other.
						<br><br>
						(3) The root node must have at least two children, unless it is a leaf.

				<h2>The Insertion Algorithm</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						Where should we insert a new record?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						First, we need to find an appropriate leaf.
						<br><br>
						(1) Start at the root node.
						<br><br>
						(2) If it's a leaf, let's choose it.
						<br><br>
						(3) If it's an internal node, let's inspect its entries:<br>
						Let's hypothetically consider we add the new record to an entry. How
						much larger do we need to the make that entry's box? Now repeat for the
						other entries. Which one needed to be enlarged the least? Choose that one.
						And if entries tie, choose the one whose area is the smallest.
						<br><br>
						Remember, the chosen entry is internal, so it points to another node. Repeat 
						this process for the next node until we get to a leaf.
					</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='page hidden'>
				<h2>The Insertion Algorithm</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						Now do we add it to the leaf we just chose?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						Maybe. Recall that a node can have at most M entries, for some M that we
						chose. If the leaf has less than M, then sure, add it. Otherwise, we'll have
						to make some room by splitting the node into two new ones...
					</span>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class='page hidden'>
				<h2>The Insertion Algorithm</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						How do we split a node?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						If we want to split node A, we could just make a new node, B, and give it
						some of node A's entries. But we want some more assurance that when we
						search in the future, we won't have to look in both of these entries. We can
						achieve this by minimizing the combined area of node A's box and node B's
						box. 
						There are a few ways of doing this:
						<br><br>
						(1) Try every combinations of groupings and pick the smallest area. This
						gives us the optimal solution, but takes a while (exponential in M,
						actually).
						<br><br>
						(2) We could use a quadratic algorithm instead. Without going into too much
						detail (this tutorial focuses on the third option), this algorithm chooses
						two "seed" entries by comparing the space wasted between pairs of entries.
						The pair of entries that waste the most space become the first entries in
						nodes A and B. It may not give us the absolute best split, but it's a lot faster.
						<br><br>
						(3) Finally, we can use a linear-time algorithm...
					</span>
				</p>

			<div class='page hidden'>
				<h2>The Insertion Algorithm</h2>
				<p>
					<span class='question'>
						How do we perform a linear split?
					</span>
					<br><br>
					<span class='answer'>
						(1) For each dimension, find the entry whose box has the highest low side,
						and the entry whose box has the lowest high side. In the x-y coordinate
						plane, this means finding a pair using the x-axis, and the pair using the
						y-axis. Once we find these, subtract to find the separation.
						<br><br>
						(2) Now find the total width (the separation of the most extreme points)
						along each dimension. On the y-axis, this means finding the highest and
						lowest y-coordinates, and subtracting.
						<br><br>
						(3) Now "normalize," by dividing the separation of each pair found in step
						(1) by the widths found in step (2).
						<br><br>
						(4) We'll choose the pair with the greatest separation as our
						starter entries for nodes A and B. This gives us a decent approximation of
						which entries would need a box that wastes the most space if they were in
						the same node.
						<br><br>
						(5) Lastly, randomly assign the remaining entries into each of the two
						nodes.
